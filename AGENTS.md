# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to AI coding agents (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and others) when working with code in this repository. `CLAUDE.md` and `.github/copilot-instructions.md` point here so the guidance lives in one place.

## What this repository is

A single file, `deployfns`: shell functions for deployment scripts, originally from mySociety (UK Citizens Online Democracy, 2004). It is consumed as a git submodule of [`openaustralia/openaustralia`](https://github.com/openaustralia/openaustralia), the umbrella repository for OpenAustralia.org.au, and sourced by deploy scripts there.

Changes here are rare and there is no build step, CI or test suite. Issues for the wider project are tracked on the umbrella repository. After merging a change here, the umbrella repository's submodule pointer needs bumping before OpenAustralia.org.au picks it up.

## Contributing

This repository has no `CONTRIBUTING.md` or templates of its own; the org-wide ones in [`openaustralia/.github`](https://github.com/openaustralia/.github) apply. Fetch the current versions rather than relying on a copy:

`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openaustralia/.github/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`

`curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openaustralia/.github/main/AGENTS.md`

Any equivalent fetch of those URLs works (web fetch, or `gh api` if the GitHub CLI
is installed); don't assume a particular tool is present.

## Agent skills

Configuration the engineering skills read. These files describe how this repo works; edit them directly rather
than re-running the setup skill.

### Issue tracker

Issues live as GitHub issues in the umbrella repo, `openaustralia/openaustralia` — issues are disabled on this
repo. Driven by the `gh` CLI with `-R openaustralia/openaustralia`. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The default five-label vocabulary: `needs-triage`, `needs-info`, `ready-for-agent`, `ready-for-human`, `wontfix`.
See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `CONTEXT.md` and one `docs/adr/` at the root, both created lazily. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.
